What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?
+ The Chill Foundation overview: a non-profit that exists to provide experiential learning activities, reflection, and discussion, paired with board sport lessons (e.g. skateboarding, snowboarding) to underprivelged youth.
+Framing Question: what regional/neighborhood areas in Colorado should be chosen as an event site for The Chill Foundation to trial their weekend pop-up event series? 

Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
+ The Chill Foundation benefits from this analysis by maximizing child turnout/participation for their event.
+ Children who normally would not have access to experience board sports get exposure to mentorship and new, healthy activities.

Data Description:
What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
Datasets I plan to use:
+ Demographic/household data: https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-american-community-survey-nbrhd-2013-2017
+ Child survey data: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/center-for-health-and-environmental-data/survey-research/healthy-kids-colorado-survey-data

What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
+ An individual sample would be the survey results to one of the questions on the Child Survey data set, for a given age in a given county region in Colorado. 

If modeling, what will you predict as your target?
+ No plans for modeling yet.

Tools:
How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?
+ I will use Google Sheets to clean my data and perform EDA. I will use Tableau to visualize trends and patterns that I discover during EDA (e.g. neighborhoods/regions with lowest median HH income and far distance to outdoor amenities).
Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?
+ No

MVP Goal:
What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
+ Provide a bar graph showing the regions with the highest population of kids under 18 years old where HH median income is less than $50K annually.
